# SAS Demographics Data Analysis & Reporting Project :bar_chart:

## Overview :sparkles:
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data analysis workflow using **SAS Studio**. The primary objective is to import, clean, and transform clinical demographic data from an Excel file, calculate summary statistics for continuous and categorical variables, and generate a professional report summarizing key baseline characteristics by treatment group. This project showcases the power and flexibility of SAS in handling real-world data analysis tasks.


## Data Source :open_file_folder:
The data is sourced from an Excel file (`M3_T3_V1_-_demog.xls`) containing demographic information such as date components (month, day, year), gender, and race for each patient. The data is located in the `/home/u64143416` directory of the SAS Studio environment.

## Project Workflow :rocket:

### 1. Data Import & Setup
- **Dropping Existing Table:**  
  The project starts by ensuring that any pre-existing table (`WORK.Demog`) is dropped to maintain a clean workspace.
- **Importing the Excel File:**  
  Using `PROC IMPORT` with the XLS engine, the Excel file is read, and the data from the "Demog" sheet is imported into the SAS `WORK.Demog` dataset. This step also includes reading the column names directly from the file.
- **Data Display:**  
  The `%web_open_table` macro is used to open the imported table for a quick review within SAS Studio.

### 2. Data Transformation
- **Date of Birth & Age Calculation:**  
  - **Concatenation:** Combines the month, day, and year fields into a valid date string.  
  - **Conversion:** Transforms the date string into a SAS date format.  
  - **Age Calculation:** Computes the age of each patient by subtracting the date of birth from the diagnosis date (`diagdt`) and dividing by 365.
- **Treatment Group Assignment:**  
  A new variable `trt` is created for grouping the patients for subsequent analyses.

### 3. Statistical Analysis

#### Continuous Variable (Age)
- **Summary Statistics Calculation:**  
  The `PROC MEANS` procedure computes statistical parameters (N, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for the age variable by treatment group.
- **Data Formatting:**  
  The results are reformatted, and appropriate ordering is assigned to facilitate seamless merging with other statistics.

#### Categorical Variables (Gender and Race)
- **Gender Analysis:**  
  - **Custom Formats:** The gender variable is recoded using a user-defined format to display as 'Male' or 'Female'.  
  - **Frequency Analysis:** The `PROC FREQ` procedure calculates the count and percentage of each gender category by treatment group.
- **Race Analysis:**  
  - **Custom Formats:** Similarly, the race variable is recoded into categories (White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, Other) using a custom format.  
  - **Frequency Analysis:** Frequencies and percentages for race are computed by treatment group.

### 4. Report Generation
- **Data Consolidation:**  
  The age, gender, and race statistics are combined into a single dataset. Sorting and transposition (using `PROC TRANSPOSE`) align the statistics for each treatment group side by side.
- **Final Report Formatting:**  
  The `PROC REPORT` procedure is used to create a formatted table with:
  - Detailed row labels (e.g., "Age (years)", "Gender", "Race")
  - Dynamic column headers showing the treatment groups along with their population counts (obtained via a `PROC SQL` query).
  - A clear title and footnote explaining the methodology and percentage calculations.

## How to Run the Project :computer:
1. **Setup SAS Studio Environment:**  
   Ensure that you have access to SAS Studio and that the Excel file `M3_T3_V1_-_demog.xls` is located in the specified directory (`/home/u64143416`).
2. **Execute the SAS Code:**  
   Open the `sas_project.sas` file in SAS Studio and run the code. The program will:
   - Import the data from the Excel file.
   - Perform necessary data transformations.
   - Compute summary statistics for age, gender, and race.
   - Generate the final report.
3. **Review the Report:**  
   The output table, generated by `PROC REPORT`, will display the demographic and baseline characteristics by treatment group. Use the SAS Studio output window to view the results.

## Key Takeaways :key:
- **Automation & Reproducibility:**  
  Automates the data import, transformation, and reporting process, ensuring consistent and reproducible analyses.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:**  
  Integrates multiple SAS procedures (e.g., `PROC IMPORT`, `PROC MEANS`, `PROC FREQ`, `PROC TRANSPOSE`, `PROC REPORT`) to deliver a full-cycle data analysis workflow.
- **Dynamic Reporting:**  
  Utilizes dynamic SQL queries to embed population counts in the final report, enhancing the interpretability of the results.

## Future Enhancements :sparkles:
- **Expanded Variable Analysis:**  
  Incorporate additional clinical or demographic variables for a more detailed analysis.
- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  Implement graphical representations (e.g., using `PROC SGPLOT`) to visually interpret the data.
- **User-Defined Parameters:**  
  Allow customization of the analysis parameters to adapt to different datasets or study requirements.
